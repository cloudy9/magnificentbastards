          <h2>Xeno</h2>
          <p>when we picked up xeno on scout we were weary due to him never playing comp tf2 before however the moment we started scrimming with him we knew we liked him his dm his comms both equally as good. i play with him also from time to time casually in tf2 and in other games and in all this time we have never lost faith in his will to carry us and our flank to win games.</p>

          <h3>Chamona aka the carrier</h3>
          <p>chamona was a late pickup he was actually a merc for a few games during the season 11 group stages but then we loved his gameplay so we asked him if we wanted to join and thats how we have one of the strongest flanks in the open division. sadly chamona dosent comm but judging by the kill feed in most games we dont need his comms because we see that he wipes the enemy team.</p>

          <h4>Skulltiger</h4>
          <p>Skulltiger had actually been in my friends list for a while since season 20 he was the team leader of a team we faced then one day when i asked him if his team could scrim he said that they had disbanded immediately i took the oppurtunity to pickupma great guy and player for our team even today he is one of th people who memes in our team but is still loved by all.</p>

          <h4>Blackhawk</h4>
          <p>Blackhawk was an original from the very beginning and we still havent lost him his game sense may be lacking but his dm make up for that in more ways than one. his energy and spirit really inspires our team to achieve great things and his patriotism for his country "france" amazes me to this day.</p>

          <h4>hotep</h4>
          <p>hotep has been a late entry to the team but one of the best for the combo his gamesense, calls and dm really shows that he is one of our top players he is liked by everyone and can be serious when needed this is why we love him on heavy especially as he is an "11/10 heavy mans".</p>

          <h4>Cloudy9</h4>
          <p>Cloudy9, a heavily bantering medic main and highlander team leader - although his diplomatic skills are far from perfect he does an excellent job at organizing his own team, be it via planning of scrims or sitting down to try and find weaknesses holding his team back. His humor may be as dry and sarcastic as any Brits', but that doesnt mean he isn't a well-meaning one.

           In game, Cloudy is a medic main as you want him - focusing on self-preservation above all else, calling when to go in or back off his always aware of both the game AND the metagame (as in being aware of UBER advantage and taking the updated number from the spy(metagame) while trying to survive against the enemy combo (game)). His calls are rather decent and the one weakness he has are days of bad luck when he gets getting caught off-guard.</p>

          <h4>Bemo aka B-man</h4>
          <p>bemo was the 3rd pickup of the team i added him off of his etf2l recruitment post then when i spoke to him in the interview i found out his previous experience a while back in season 13 of ugc as engineer so his experience has really helped us as a team and due to his comms being so on point and his personality really helps the team through tough times with his light humour he brings to the team.</p>

          <h4>Fenrir Darkfang aka Youtube man</h4>
          <p>fenrir darkfang started off as a lowly sub but as our spy wanted to focus on 6s fenrir stepped up to the plate he is a spy main with alot of enthusiasm his personality really brings this team together and i couldnt write about fenrir without alking about his youtube channel which is made just to further the communty this is through no gain of his own this is just from a guy who wants his community to grow.</p>
