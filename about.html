            <p>We started off just as a very low open team where barely anyone of us had any previous experience and now we have moved to top of the tables becuase of our will power and passion as a team and the friendship mixed with the comradery has kept us together throughout all of these seasons.</p>
  </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h1>how we started.</h1>
          <p>so when we started off we were 3 players who left one team to create this team sadly two of the three have had to leave over the past months however they left me in charge i am the organiser, maincaller leader of the team we started scrimming instantly and then we entered into season 20 of ugc and thats where it all hit off.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col">
          <h1>how we got to where we are today</h1>
          <p>so our original roster had no real organisation so i decided to change it up so we looked for new people we started off with getting bemo who is now one of our favourite players then we picked up xeno who is the most consistent and has the best comms so hes one of the best flank players we could ever of asked for now our current main spy "fenrir darkfang" started of on sub and then our main had to leave to focus on 6s so we put fenrir on main and he is the nicest guy you could ever meetin this community that we would never want to replace then we got a huge pickup who we to this day call our carry its "chamona aka the carrier" when we put him in the flank we started winning most games. then our last pick who is the most important our mentor STINGHAN who is such a help and he is helping us through the season and hopefully to playoffs.</p>
